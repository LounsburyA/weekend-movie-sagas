# Movie sagas project




This project has a grid of movies that displays on the DOM. When a specific movie is clicked the user is brought to a page that displays details about 
that movie.
A data base was created to hold all the movies, details, and genres.
In order to get this all working a movie items component was made to and imported to the movie list component that displayed the movie items.  A button was added to the movie items the takes the user to the details page. The details page loads all the information about that specific movie.  A GET route was created for the movie genres. This was used in the details component to add the genres to all the rest of the movie details. 
I used Material UI to create a grid for all movies on the home page, It was a bit of a challenge incorporating the proper code into the movie item and movie list components.  I added to the styling with CSS.
